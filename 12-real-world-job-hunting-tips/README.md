## **🚀 20 Real-World Job Hunting Tips for DevOps Engineers (with Code!)**

Whether you're applying to your 1st or 10th DevOps job—this guide is packed with real advice, metrics, and even code to help you stand out. 

 

## **🔧 Technical Portfolio Tips** 

## **1. Showcase Your GitHub with Infrastructure Code** 

Hiring managers love seeing real work. Create a repo with reusable Terraform or Ansible code. 

# terraform/aws/ec2/main.tf 
resource "aws_instance" "web" { 
  ami           = "ami-0abcdef1234567890" 
  instance_type = "t2.micro" 
  tags = { 
    Name = "JobSearch-Demo" 
  } 
} 
  

📌 Pin this repo. Add a solid README. Bonus if it includes terraform plan output or a diagram.png. 

 

## **2. Include a CI/CD Workflow in Your Repos** 

Use GitHub Actions to show how you deploy/test your apps. 

# .github/workflows/deploy.ymllol 

 
\name: CI/CD Pipeline 
 
 

?><12	q`on: [push] 
 
jobs: 
  build: 
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest 
    steps: 
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2 
      - name: Setup Node.js 
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3 
        with: 
          node-version: '16' 
      - run: npm install 
      - run: npm run test 
  

👀 This proves you understand automation and pipelines. 

 

## **3. Automate with Bash or Python** 

Even a simple automation script like this can show value: 

#!/bin/bash 
# restart dockerized app and tail logs 
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d 
docker-compose logs -f 
  

 

## **📄 Resume & Visibility Tips** 

## **4. Quantify Your Work** 

Instead of: 

Managed EC2 servers and Jenkins jobs 

Try: 

Reduced build times by 60% using parallel stages in Jenkins 

 Cut infrastructure cost by 25% via autoscaling group optimizations 

📈 Use numbers—they stand out like green on a Grafana dashboard. 

 

## **5. List Real Tools, Not Buzzwords** 

✅ Good: 

Kubernetes (Helm, ArgoCD) 

Terraform (AWS VPC, EC2, S3 Modules) 

Prometheus + Grafana 

GitHub Actions, GitLab CI 

❌ Bad: 

DevOps tools 

CI/CD experience 

AWS knowledge 

 

## **💬 Interview Prep with Technical Questions** 

## **6. Explain Infrastructure Clearly** 

"Draw your architecture" is a classic prompt. Prepare something like this: 

# simple eks cluster with private subnets 
module "eks" { 
  source          = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws" 
  cluster_name    = "jobsearch-cluster" 
  subnets         = ["subnet-1", "subnet-2"] 
  manage_aws_auth = true 
} 
  

Be ready to explain why you chose private/public subnets, how you handle node autoscaling, and observability. 

 

## **7. Practice Debug Scenarios** 

You might be asked: 

## **"A container won't start—what do you do?"** 

✅ Mention: 

kubectl describe pod <pod-name> 
kubectl logs <pod-name> 
  

Then talk about checking readiness probes, PVCs, config maps, and Dockerfile issues. 

 

Filter with: 

 DevOps, SRE, Platform Engineer, Cloud Engineer, Remote, LATAM preferred. 

 

## **9. Join DevOps Communities** 

These help you network, learn, and even find referrals: 

Slack: DevOpsChat, Kubernetes, Platform Engineers   
Reddit: r/devops, r/aws, r/terraform   
Discord: Cloud Native, HashiCorp   
  

 

## **🧠 Soft Skills Matter** 

## **10. Use STAR Method in Behavioral Interviews** 

For example: 

## **"Tell me about a time a deployment went wrong?"** 

Structure: 

**Situation** – “We pushed a major config change…” 

**Task** – “It affected all staging deployments…” 

**Action** – “I rolled back using Helm…” 

**Result** – “Resolved outage in 7 mins, added rollback step to pipeline.” 

 

## **⚙️ Bonus Technical Tips** 

## **11. Learn k9s and htop for Live Demos** 

They're perfect for live troubleshooting during interviews. 

k9s   # Interactive K8s UI 
htop  # Real-time system resource viewer 
  

 

## **12. Show Cost Optimization Projects** 

Talk about using tools like: 

# S3 lifecycle rule JSON snippet 
"Transitions": [ 
  { 
    "Days": 30, 
    "StorageClass": "GLACIER" 
  } 
] 
  

💸 Hiring managers love people who think in terms of performance and cost. 

 

## **🏁 Wrap-Up** 

Getting hired in DevOps isn’t about listing every tool—it’s about showing how you solve real problems, automate smartly, scale efficiently, and collaborate fearlessly. 

Build your narrative. Back it with code. Share it with the world.
