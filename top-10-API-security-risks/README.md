# **Top 10 API Security Risks: A Deep Dive into the OWASP List and How to Defend Against Them.**

In today’s digitally connected world, APIs are the backbone of modern applications. From mobile apps to SaaS platforms, they enable seamless data exchange and user experiences. But with this connectivity comes risk. APIs are now prime targets for cyberattacks, and failing to secure them can lead to devastating data breaches. 

That’s why the **Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)** created the 
[API Security Top 10](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/as-devops-takes-off-site-reliability-engineers-are-flying-high/), a globally recognized standard outlining the most critical API vulnerabilities. Understanding and defending against these risks is *absolutely non-negotiable* for developers, security professionals, and product teams alike.  
 

# **Protect Your APIs from OWASP's Top 10 Security Threats**

## * **Broken Object Level Authorization**  
Attackers manipulate object IDs to access data they shouldn’t see, leading to unauthorized data exposure or tampering.  
*(Occurred in 38% of reported API breaches in 2024)*

## * **Broken Authentication**  
By exploiting weak login mechanisms or tokens, attackers gain unauthorized access to user accounts and API endpoints.  
*(Accounted for 29% of API vulnerabilities reported in Q1 2025)*

## * **Broken Object Property Level Authorization**  
Attackers modify hidden or sensitive fields (like roles or permissions) via APIs not enforcing field-level access control.  
*(Frequently exploited in business logic abuse cases, up 21% YoY)*

## * **Unrestricted Resource Consumption**  
By flooding APIs with excessive requests, attackers exhaust system resources, causing downtime or degraded performance.  
*(Contributed to 19% of API performance issues in 2025 reports)*

## * **Broken Function Level Authorization**  
Attackers access privileged functions (like admin actions) by invoking endpoints that lack proper user role checks.  
*(Observed in 24% of enterprise-grade API audits)*

## * **Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows**  
Automation scripts abuse business logic flaws in APIs to perform actions like bulk purchases or scraping, bypassing limits.  
*(Emerging concern with rising automation hacks in 2025)*

## * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
Attackers trick the API server into making internal requests, often leading to internal data leaks or remote code execution.  
*(High-impact risk, particularly in multi-cloud environments)*

## * **Security Misconfiguration**  
Default or misconfigured settings (like open ports or verbose error messages) give attackers easy access to system details.  
*(Still a top cause of API-related breaches in 2025)*

## * **Improper Inventory Management**  
Outdated or undocumented APIs remain exposed, letting attackers target forgotten endpoints with known vulnerabilities.  
*(Detected in over 50% of mature orgs during 2025 risk assessments)*

## * **Unsafe Consumption of APIs**  
Blindly trusting third-party APIs without sanitizing responses can let attackers inject malicious data or steal user info.  
*(Common in third-party integrations; flagged in 30% of supply chain attacks)*


# **Defending Against These Risks: Real-World Approaches**

* Implement strict access controls and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).  
* Use OAuth 2.0 and token-based authentication.  
* Apply rate limiting and quota enforcement to prevent abuse.  
* Use API gateways with built-in threat detection.  
* Continuously test APIs with dynamic and static security testing tools.  
* Encrypt all data in transit and at rest.  

# **Tools & Best Practices to Stay Ahead**

* **Tools:** Postman, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, 42Crunch, and API gateways like Kong or Apigee.
* **Practices:**  
Shift-left security (start early in the dev process)  
Use schema validation (e.g., JSON Schema)  
Automate security scans in CI/CD pipelines  


## **Security is a Team Sport**

While DevSecOps may lead the charge, API security is everyone’s responsibility. Developers must write secure code, QA teams should test for vulnerabilities, and product managers need to understand the implications of insecure APIs. It takes collaboration across teams to truly protect modern applications.  

## **Securing the Future of Digital Innovation**

In a world where APIs drive critical business functions, securing them isn’t optional; It’s foundational. The OWASP API Security Top 10 provides a clear path to identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities before they become breaches.

At **Zazz**, we don’t just build cutting-edge digital products; we engineer them with **security at the core**. From development to deployment, our teams integrate best practices in **API protection, secure coding, and compliance** to ensure every product we ship is resilient, scalable, and safe. 

Because for us, delivering innovation goes hand in hand with **safeguarding user trust and data integrity** in an ever-evolving tech landscape.
